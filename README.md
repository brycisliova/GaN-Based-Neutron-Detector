## Overview

This project explores the potential of Gallium Nitride (GaN) as a material for neutron detection, leveraging its wide bandgap, radiation hardness, and thermal stability. GaN’s unique properties make it a promising alternative to conventional materials for neutron detectors, with applications in **nuclear safety**, **space exploration**, and **national security**. This theoretical study investigates the viability of GaN-based detectors based on existing research, providing a foundation for future experimental setups.

## Research Highlights

1. **Material and Growth Techniques**  
   GaN is typically synthesized using **Metal-Organic Chemical Vapor Deposition (MOCVD)** or **Hydride Vapor Phase Epitaxy (HVPE)**, with doping elements like **Silicon** and **Gadolinium** to enhance its scintillation properties. The study references literature on the effectiveness of doped GaN for gamma discrimination and neutron sensitivity.

2. **Detector Configuration**  
   Theoretical models of GaN detectors are designed as **Schottky diodes** with neutron conversion layers like **Boron-10 (B-10)** and **Lithium Fluoride (6LiF)**. These materials increase neutron capture efficiency by emitting high-energy particles upon neutron interaction, which are then detected by the GaN semiconductor.

3. **Theoretical Performance Analysis**  
   GaN’s wide bandgap minimizes noise, making it suitable for high-radiation environments. This study evaluates expected detection efficiency, response time, and noise levels for GaN detectors based on insights from previous research.

4. **Signal Processing and Calibration**  
   Prospective signal processing techniques are explored to enhance the accuracy of neutron detection. Literature-based models of **energy calibration curves** and **charge collection efficiency** are also reviewed for future experimental setup and optimization.
